Servlet:
    client sends request to server expecting a response
    That response may be a static page or dynamic page(page that is created at run time)
    When client requests a dynamic page that request is sent to helper application(Web container)
    This web container consists of servlets. 
    This servlet will take the request and fetch the value and sends the reponse
    Web container
        Tomcat
        Glassfish
        IBM websphere
    Inside the web container we have file called deployment descripter(Web.xml) in which we mention which request coresponds to which servlets.
    web.xml has two tags servlet tag and servlet-mapping tag which describes the mapping.
    Servlet is a normal class that extends httpservlet class
GET and POST requests:
    HTTP protocol has 5 mthods to work with.
        GET
        POST
        PUT
        Delete
        OPTIONS
    Normally when we want to send data to the server we use post request
    to fetch data we use get request
    When no method is submitted in the HTML it will assume a GET request.
        When we send a GET request to server it will diplay in the URL and concats in the end. So when sending username and passowrd type data we use post request
We can control the type of request processed in the class also.
    HTTP servlet provides us two methods to use instead of service 
        doGet
        doPost
