Spring

Spring Bean:
    Spring Bean is simply a Java object.
    When Java objects are created by the Spring Container, then Spring refers to them as "Spring Beans".
    Spring Beans are created from normal Java classes .... just like Java objects.
Inversion of control:
    it is simply design process of externalising construction and management of objects
    Outsource to an object factory
    Any app that is configurable needs to use a object factory
    Create and manage objects

Dependancy injection:
    Inject object dependencies
    Outsource the construction and injection of object to extrenal entity

Configuring Spring Container can be done by:
    XML config file
    Java annotations
    Java Source code

Spring development process:
    1) configure the spring beans
        XMl:
        in the bean tags specify the objects we need to use in the application
        <beans>
            <bean id ="name" class="Qualified name to Retrive the bean"></bean>
        </beans>
    2) Create Spring Container
        Generally known as application context used to read XML,annotations or Sourcecode
            ClassPathXmlApplicationContext
            AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
            GenericWebApplicationContext

    3) Retrive Spring beans from the container
        After creating the application context object we use object.getBean("name", interface) to retrive the bean
        this process helps our app to be configurable

Injection types:
    constructor injection
        Define the dependancy and its class
        Create a constructor in your class functions
        configure the dependancy injection in the spring config file
            in the bean to which we need to inject we just add constructor arg ref field in the xml file
    Setter Injection
        This is where spring inject dependencies by just calling setter methods on your class
            Create setter methods in your classes for injections
            configure the dependancy injection in the XML file 
                unlike dependancy injection we will add property tag in the bean to inje
    
    Bean Scopes and lifecycle:
        ct into setters as per the property name give as camelcase settername
    
    Injecting literal values:
        Create setter methods in the class
        configure the injection in the xml file
            in the bean tag we add property tag to inject literal values same as the setter injection(instead of ref we will give value)
    
    Inject values from the property file:
        Create the properties file
            Just write the file with properties as propertyname: name and save as .properties file
        Load properties values into the XML
            <context:property-placeholder location: file location>
        Ref the properties form the file directly
            Similar to injecting literals we just ref the value to the propertyname in the properties file

Bean Scopes and lifecycle:
